## 🐝 v0.1.0 — The Agent Is Born

The first release of The Hive. One agent. One machine. Talking.

### What's in v0.1

- `hive init` — full birth flow. Name, DOB, location, profession, about, provider, model, API key. Runs once. Your agent is yours.
- `hive chat` — streaming conversations with full memory context. Feels like talking to something that knows you.
- `hive config` — change provider, model, or API key on the fly. No reinit needed.
- `hive status` — see your agent, provider, model, DB size, prompts loaded.
- `hive nuke` — full wipe. Agent, memory, keys. Gone.
- Multi-provider — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, Groq, Mistral, OpenRouter, Together
- Local-first — everything stored in `~/.hive/`. Nothing in the cloud.
- API keys in OS keychain — never written to disk in plaintext.
- Prompts folder — drop `.md` files into `~/.hive/prompts/` to shape your agent's behavior permanently.

### Install

````bash
npm install -g @imisbahk/hive
hive init
````

## 🐝 v0.1.1 — Chat-First CLI + Command Centre Upgrades

### What's in v0.1.1

- `hive` now opens interactive chat by default.
- `hive chat` is now deprecated (still supported as an alias).
- In-chat command suggestions: type `/` to see matching commands while typing.
- In-chat Hive shortcuts:
  - `/hive status`
  - `/hive config show`
  - `/hive config provider`
  - `/hive config model`
  - `/hive config key`
- Embedded config flows in chat now keep session continuity and recover terminal input state.
- Chat input hardening:
  - bare `/` resolves locally instead of falling through to model messages
  - unknown slash commands are handled locally with clear errors

### Upgrade

```bash
npm install -g @imisbahk/hive@0.1.1
```

## 🐝 v0.1.2 — Themes + Live Accent Preview

### What's in v0.1.2

  - `rose` (`#FF4081`)
  - `slate` (`#90A4AE`)
  - `green` (`#00E676`)
  - `custom` (user-provided hex)

- Theme persistence in local DB metadata (`~/.hive/hive.db`):
  - `theme`
  - `theme_hex`
- Accent color is now consistent across the command centre UI:
  - ASCII HIVE wordmark

## 🐝 v0.1.3 — Doctor (Health Checks)

### What's in v0.1.3

- New `hive doctor` command runs a full diagnostic pass across local Hive setup.

  - API key present in OS keychain
  - Provider reachability (5s timeout)
  - Prompts folder present with files

## 🐝 v0.1.4 — Memory + Update Awareness

### What's in v0.1.4

- Memory actually shapes replies: every chat turn injects pinned facts plus top 3 relevant episodic memories, and saves a new episode summary after each exchange.
- New in-chat commands:
  - `/recap` — summarize persona + knowledge graph
  - `/save <title>` — set conversation title
  - `/pin <fact>` — pin facts that always enter context
  - `/status` — show mode/provider/model/conversation id
  - `/retry` — resend last user message
  - `/copy` — copy last reply to clipboard
- New CLI command group: `hive memory`
  - `hive memory list` — list knowledge (pinned flagged)
  - `hive memory clear` — wipe episodic memory (with confirmation)
  - `hive memory show` — print current persona
- Auto-update check on chat start: warns when a newer npm release is available (3s timeout; non-blocking).
- `/hive memory ...` shortcuts available directly inside chat.
- Help/menu surfaces now include every chat and memory command.
- `/exit` handling normalized so it exits immediately even with stray spaces/case.

### Upgrade

```bash
npm install -g @imisbahk/hive@0.1.4
```
