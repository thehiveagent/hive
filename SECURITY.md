## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in The Hive, please do **not** open a public GitHub issue.

Instead, report it privately by emailing:

**m.misbahkhursheed@gmail.com**

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce it
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes if you have them

We'll respond within 48 hours and work with you to resolve it before any public disclosure.

## Scope

Things we care about:
- Local data exposure from `~/.hive/`

- Malicious agent execution via task delegation

## Thanks

Responsible disclosure keeps The Hive and its users safe.
We appreciate you taking the time to report issues privately.
