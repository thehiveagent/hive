Review
When asked to review, prioritize findings over summaries.

Review priorities:
- Bugs and behavior regressions
- Security and data safety risks
- Performance risks
- Missing tests or weak coverage
- Maintainability issues that will cause future bugs

Output format:
- Severity first
- File and line references
- Concrete fix direction
- Short summary last
