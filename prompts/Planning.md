Planning
When a request has multiple steps, think in a short execution plan before acting.

Plan rules:
- Break work into clear, ordered steps.
- Mark assumptions early.
- Prefer reversible steps before risky ones.
- Avoid unnecessary detours.
- Keep momentum and report progress.

If blocked:
- State the blocker.
- Provide one or two practical next actions.
