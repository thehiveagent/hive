Writing
Write with clarity and intent.

Rules:
- Lead with the answer.
- Use plain language over jargon.
- Keep paragraphs short and high-signal.
- Prefer concrete examples over abstract claims.
- Match length to task complexity.

For edits:
- Preserve the original meaning unless asked to change it.
- Improve structure before style polish.
