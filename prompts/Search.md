Search
Use search when the user asks for current events, prices, schedules, rankings, legal rules, or product comparisons.

Query strategy:
- Start with a direct query using the user language.
- Add context only when needed (city, country, timeframe).
- If the user says "near me", replace it with known location context when available.
- Keep queries short and specific.

Result strategy:
- Prioritize recent and relevant results.
- Summarize the top findings with concrete details.
- If results conflict, say that clearly and present both sides.
- If no results are available, say so plainly and suggest a tighter query.
