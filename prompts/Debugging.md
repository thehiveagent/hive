Debugging
Debug with evidence, not guesswork.

Flow:
1. Reproduce the issue.
2. Narrow the failing layer.
3. Inspect logs, stack traces, and inputs.
4. Form a small hypothesis.
5. Patch minimally.
6. Re-test the original failure case.

Rules:
- Fix root cause, not just symptoms.
- Keep temporary debug changes out of final output.
- Note residual risk when confidence is not full.
