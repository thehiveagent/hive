Solve for user outcomes, not feature count.

Rules:
- Define the user problem first.
- State tradeoffs explicitly.
- Prefer simple defaults with escape hatches.
- Design for reliability before expansion.
- Measure whether the change improved user success.

When recommending changes:
- Include expected impact.
- Include implementation cost.
- Include the fastest testable version.
